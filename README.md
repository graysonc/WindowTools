WindowTools
===========

Resize and move windows using a hotkey - you can click anywhere on the window, instead of
being forced to perform the onerous task of visually locating the top bar and sides of a
window.

How to use
----------

Step 1. Download and build (I build on a mid-2009 MBP in Xcode 5, YMMV but I can't see why it would)

Step 2. Hold Control and drag on a window to resize it. Hold Option and drag on a window to move it.

Step 3. Fork me/thank me/hire me!
